One night, he punished Alexander very badly. This difficult event helped make Alexander a fearless and strong man. Even as a young man, Alexander was special. He did not have a beard. He ordered all his soldiers to shave their faces, too. This rule for soldiers is still used today. He was a student of the famous teacher Aristotle. He learned about war and how to lead an army. He became a commander when he was still a teenager. Alexander wanted to conquer the whole world. He took control of many huge lands like Persia and Egypt. He even traveled as far as India. His army grew bigger and stronger. However, great power brought danger. When he was at the River Indus, his own generals turned against him. They poisoned him because they were tired of fighting.

He led a small attack and then pretended to run away in fear. The Mongols chased him into a valley without looking carefully. Suddenly, the rest of the Mamluk army appeared from their hiding places. The trap worked perfectly, and they defeated the Mongol army. This victory was very important because it stopped the Mongols from taking the region. Soon after, Baybars became the Sultan of Egypt and Syria. He was a good ruler. He built bridges, canals, and roads to help people travel. He also made a fast mail system using horses.

Venice and the Vatican noticed him and supported his studies, seeing him as useful for their secret plans. He became a skilled physician, respected for his knowledge and precision. When the Ottomans rose and Mehmed II captured Constantinople, Venice and the Church feared his power. Jacobi was sent east under the name Yakup. He entered the Ottoman palace and served with care. He treated soldiers and advised pashas. Mehmed trusted him and made him head physician. To the sultan, he seemed loyal, but some whispered that he still served Venice and the Vatican. In 1481, Mehmed prepared for a new campaign. Soon he fell ill. Yakup gave him medicine, and the sultan died. Suspicion fell on Yakup. Some said palace guards killed him; others said he fled but was captured. Jacobi, who had risen from poverty to the highest position in the Ottoman court, ended his life in mystery.",

The Ottomans captured the main city, but winter was coming. The army needed to return to safety. Sinan Pasha ordered his soldiers to retreat to the Danube River. To cross the wide river, the army used a long wooden bridge at Giurgiu. The crossing was very slow. The soldiers carried heavy carts filled with treasure and goods. This delayed everyone. Sinan Pasha and the main army crossed first. He left the famous 'Akıncı' warriors at the back to guard the bridge. Suddenly, Michael the Brave arrived with his cannons. He saw the army was split in two. He fired directly at the bridge. The wood broke, and the bridge collapsed into the water. The Akıncı warriors were trapped on the wrong side. They could not escape the enemy or the deep river. Thousands of Akıncı soldiers died that day. Before this event, they were the most famous riders in the Ottoman army. Because of this single disaster, the Akıncı lost their strength and never recovered. In history, this sad event is called the 'Bridge Disaster.'",

He started his career as a sailor and a pirate in the Mediterranean Sea. His interesting nickname, 'Mezamorta,' means 'half-dead' in Italian. In a big battle against the Venetians, he was hurt very badly. His enemies thought he was dead, but he survived. Because of this amazing event, he got his famous name. By 1674, he was a captain and attacked many enemy ships. In 1683, the French navy attacked Algiers. The leader of Algiers wanted to give up, but Mezamorta refused. He became the new ruler and defended the city. To show his strength, he put the French consul into a large cannon and fired him at the enemy ships. This stopped the French attack. Later, he attacked the French coast until they agreed to peace. Later, Mezamorta went to Istanbul to join the Ottoman navy. In 1695, he won back Chios Island from the Venetians. Because of this victory, the Sultan made him the Grand Admiral, or 'Kapudan Pasha.' He changed how the navy fought. He stopped using old rowing ships and started using big sailing ships called 'kalyons.' Mezamorta died from an illness in 1701 while getting ready for a new war.",

Cities on the coast supported him with supplies. He captured Portuguese ships and built a small castle in Mombasa. The Portuguese sent a large fleet to destroy him. In 1589, Portuguese ships attacked Mombasa with heavy guns. Suddenly, a group of warriors called the Zimba attacked from the land. The Zimba were cannibals. During the battle, they caught and ate Ottoman soldiers. The city faced attacks from both sides at the same time. Mir Ali Beg tried to escape, but the Portuguese captured him. They sent him to Portugal as a prisoner. He lived there for the rest of his life. This battle ended the Ottoman attempts to control East Africa.

However, the Austrian general, Prince Eugene of Savoy, was very clever. He had spies inside the Ottoman army who told him exactly where the Sultan planned to cross the Tisa River. At the river, the Ottoman leaders made a terrible mistake. Greedy commanders, called Pashas, stopped the soldiers at the narrow bridge. They demanded money from their own men before allowing them to cross. This caused a long delay. Prince Eugene saw the confusion and attacked with heavy cannons. The bridge broke, and thousands of soldiers died in the water while the Sultan watched helplessly from the other side. The results were a disaster. The Ottomans lost 30,000 men, valuable treasure, and the Sultan’s official seal. Sultan Mustafa was heartbroken and never led an army again.

He led many successful Viking journeys. In 845, he attacked Paris with a large group of Viking ships. The French king paid him a great amount of silver to leave the city. This made Ragnar very wealthy and increased his fame. Ragnar had several sons who also became famous Viking warriors. Their names were Ivar the Boneless, Bjorn Ironside, and Halfdan Ragnarsson. These sons later led the Great Heathen Army in England. Ragnar died during an attack on England. King Aella of Northumbria captured him and put him in a snake pit as punishment. Before he died, Ragnar said that his sons would punish King Aella for killing him. His sons kept this promise. They attacked England, captured King Aella, and killed him to avenge their father's death.",
