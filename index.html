One night, he punished Alexander very badly. This difficult event helped make Alexander a fearless and strong man. Even as a young man, Alexander was special. He did not have a beard. He ordered all his soldiers to shave their faces, too. This rule for soldiers is still used today. He was a student of the famous teacher Aristotle. He learned about war and how to lead an army. He became a commander when he was still a teenager. Alexander wanted to conquer the whole world. He took control of many huge lands like Persia and Egypt. He even traveled as far as India. His army grew bigger and stronger. However, great power brought danger. When he was at the River Indus, his own generals turned against him. They poisoned him because they were tired of fighting.

It seemed that the Ottomans were ready for a great victory. Although the army had the chance to destroy the Russians, Baltacı Mehmet Pasha accepted peace. With the Treaty of Prut, Russia gave back the city of Azov and promised to stay away from Ottoman lands. Peter the Great and his army were allowed to leave safely.

He was smart and strong, so he quickly became an important commander. At this time, a dangerous army called the Mongols was attacking the Middle East. They destroyed many cities and never lost a big battle. In 1260, the Mongols tried to enter Egypt. Baybars met them at a place called Ain Jalut. He used a clever plan to win. He led a small attack and then pretended to run away in fear. The Mongols chased him into a valley without looking carefully. Suddenly, the rest of the Mamluk army appeared from their hiding places. The trap worked perfectly, and they defeated the Mongol army. This victory was very important because it stopped the Mongols from taking the region. Soon after, Baybars became the Sultan of Egypt and Syria. He was a good ruler. He built bridges, canals, and roads to help people travel. He also made a fast mail system using horses.

Princip and his friends from a secret group wanted to kill him. Their first plan with a bomb did not work. Later that day, Princip saw the Archduke's car by accident. The driver had made a wrong turn and stopped near him. Princip walked to the car and shot the Archduke and his wife. Both died from their injuries. The police caught Princip right away. Because he was under 20, he could not receive the death penalty. He was sent to prison, where he became sick and died in 1918. The killing of Archduke Franz Ferdinand started a major conflict. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. This led other countries to join the fight, beginning the First World War. People still disagree about Gavrilo Princip today.

In July 1877, Russian and Romanian armies attacked Plevna. Osman Pasha quickly organized the defenses and built strong trenches around the town. His clever tactics helped the Ottomans, who had a smaller army, to win several battles. People in Europe admired his courage and military skill. For five months, his army resisted one of the biggest forces in Europe. Although his soldiers were tired and food and ammunition became less, Osman Pasha did not want to surrender. In December 1877, when there was no food or ammunition left, Osman Pasha tried to attack the enemy. He was wounded and captured... but the Russians respected him and treated him with dignity. After the war, Osman Pasha returned to Istanbul as a hero and was given the title 'Gazi.' His defense of Plevna is still remembered as a great moment in Ottoman history.",

The Ottomans, under the command of Halil Pasha, surrounded the town and cut off supplies. The British hoped that new troops would arrive to save them, but Ottoman forces stopped every attempt.

The Ottomans were taking land from the Byzantine Empire. Dušan used this situation to expand his own territory, capturing parts of Macedonia and Greece. Dušan recognized the Ottoman threat. He tried to form alliances with other Christian nations to stop them. He spoke with the Pope and Venice about creating a united army against the Ottomans. He also made agreements with the Ottomans when it suited him. Sometimes he hired Ottoman soldiers for his army. Other times he made peace treaties with them. Dušan's main goal was to capture Constantinople before the Ottomans could. He wanted to create a Christian empire strong enough to resist the Ottomans. However, Dušan died suddenly in 1355. After his death, his empire weakened and became divided. Without his leadership, later Serbian rulers could not stop the Ottomans.
