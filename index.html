Alexander grew up with these snakes. Poisonous snakes bit him, so his body became strong against poison. His father, King Philip II, was a very strict ruler. One night, he punished Alexander very badly. This difficult event helped make Alexander a fearless and strong man. Even as a young man, Alexander was special. He did not have a beard. He ordered all his soldiers to shave their faces, too. This rule for soldiers is still used today. He was a student of the famous teacher Aristotle. He learned about war and how to lead an army. He became a commander when he was still a teenager. Alexander wanted to conquer the whole world. He took control of many huge lands like Persia and Egypt. He even traveled as far as India. His army grew bigger and stronger. However, great power brought danger. When he was at the River Indus, his own generals turned against him. They poisoned him because they were tired of fighting.

At that time, Russia was growing stronger under Tsar Peter the Great. The Ottomans, with the help of the Crimean Tatars, marched to stop them. Baltacı Mehmet Pasha led the Ottoman army to the Prut River, where they surrounded the Russian forces. The Russians were trapped, hungry, and weak. It seemed that the Ottomans were ready for a great victory. Although the army had the chance to destroy the Russians, Baltacı Mehmet Pasha accepted peace. With the Treaty of Prut, Russia gave back the city of Azov and promised to stay away from Ottoman lands. Peter the Great and his army were allowed to leave safely. Some people praised Baltacı Mehmet Pasha for avoiding more bloodshed. Others blamed him for not using the chance to defeat Russia completely.

Mamluks were special soldier-slaves who went to strict military schools to learn fighting. Baybars trained very hard with horses and weapons. He was smart and strong, so he quickly became an important commander. At this time, a dangerous army called the Mongols was attacking the Middle East. They destroyed many cities and never lost a big battle. In 1260, the Mongols tried to enter Egypt. Baybars met them at a place called Ain Jalut. He used a clever plan to win. He led a small attack and then pretended to run away in fear. The Mongols chased him into a valley without looking carefully. Suddenly, the rest of the Mamluk army appeared from their hiding places. The trap worked perfectly, and they defeated the Mongol army. This victory was very important because it stopped the Mongols from taking the region. Soon after, Baybars became the Sultan of Egypt and Syria. He was a good ruler. He built bridges, canals, and roads to help people travel. He also made a fast mail system using horses.

These cruel actions made Boudica very angry. She decided to fight against Roman rule. Boudica gathered warriors from different Celtic tribes. She became their leader. They attacked Roman towns and forts across eastern Britain. Their most important victories destroyed the cities of Camulodunum, Londinium, and Verulamium. The Roman governor Suetonius led a large army to stop Boudica. At the final battle in 61 AD, the Roman army defeated Boudica's forces, although her army was much larger.

He believed Acre would open the road for him to enter Anatolia and perhaps challenge the Ottoman Empire itself. With modern cannons and a strong army, he began a long siege. Although Napoleon’s army was powerful and had won many victories before, Acre did not fall. Cezzar Ahmed Pasha defended the city with courage and discipline. He was supported by British ships under Admiral Sidney Smith, who gave him weapons and naval help. For two months, Napoleon’s forces tried again and again, but the walls of Acre resisted. At last, Napoleon abandoned the siege and returned to Egypt. This failure damaged his reputation and stopped his dreams in the East.

He was accused of treachery and sent into exile. Although he had to leave his king, Rodrigo gathered loyal soldiers and fought to survive. He often worked with Muslim rulers and fought for them when it helped his cause. His respect for Muslim soldiers and leaders made him different from other Christian knights of his time. The most important moment in his life came in 1094, when he took the city of Valencia. Many Muslim families still lived there, and Rodrigo let them stay in the city under his rule. He kept peace with nearby Muslim states and sometimes hired Muslim soldiers to fight for him. His skill in battle and understanding of Muslim customs helped him keep Valencia safe from both Christian and Muslim enemies. Rodrigo continued to defend the city until he died in 1099.

Food and water became very scarce. Soldiers and people even ate locusts to survive. Still, Fahrettin Pasha never gave up. He sent the holy relics to Istanbul for safety and refused to surrender, saying: 'I will not lower the Turkish flag with my own hands!'. Even after the war ended, he resisted, but was finally forced to give up by his own officers. As he left Medina, he cried: 'O Messenger of God, they are taking me by force!'. Later, he was sent into exile in Egypt and Malta. In 1921, he was freed and joined the Turkish War of Independence.

The driver had made a wrong turn and stopped near him. Princip walked to the car and shot the Archduke and his wife. Both died from their injuries. The police caught Princip right away. Because he was under 20, he could not receive the death penalty. He was sent to prison, where he became sick and died in 1918. The killing of Archduke Franz Ferdinand started a major conflict. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. This led other countries to join the fight, beginning the First World War. People still disagree about Gavrilo Princip today.

In December 1877, when there was no food or ammunition left, Osman Pasha tried to attack the enemy. He was wounded and captured... but the Russians respected him and treated him with dignity.

A British army of about 13,000 soldiers, led by General Townshend, entered the town of Kut after a defeat at Ctesiphon. The Ottomans, under the command of Halil Pasha, surrounded the town and cut off supplies. The British hoped that new troops would arrive to save them, but Ottoman forces stopped every attempt. Although the British army was better equipped, hunger and disease became stronger enemies inside the town. After 147 days of resistance, General Townshend surrendered on 29 April 1916. More than 13,000 British and Indian soldiers were taken as prisoners. This victory gave the Ottoman Empire great pride. It showed that the empire could still fight strongly against a world power. For the British, it was one of the worst defeats in their military history. For the Ottomans, Kut al-Amara became a symbol of courage and resistance in the dark days of World War I.",

For centuries, Muslims had controlled large parts of Spain. In 1492, Isabella and Ferdinand's armies captured Granada, the last Muslim kingdom in Iberia. This victory ended hundreds of years of conflict. Although many Muslims and Jews had lived peacefully in Spain, the monarchs wanted only Christianity to remain. They ordered Muslims and Jews to convert or leave the country. Many families lost their homes and were forced to start new lives elsewhere. The same year, Isabella and Ferdinand also supported Christopher Columbus's voyage. This journey led to the discovery of the Americas by Europeans and the beginning of Spain's overseas empire. Isabella and Ferdinand changed the history of Spain forever. They built a strong monarchy, spread Christianity, and opened the way for Spanish power around the world.

He became the new ruler and defended the city. To show his strength, he put the French consul into a large cannon and fired him at the enemy ships. This stopped the French attack. Later, he attacked the French coast until they agreed to peace. Later, Mezamorta went to Istanbul to join the Ottoman navy. In 1695, he won back Chios Island from the Venetians. Because of this victory, the Sultan made him the Grand Admiral, or 'Kapudan Pasha.' He changed how the navy fought.

The Visigoth king, Roderick, was a harsh ruler. There were many problems inside his kingdom, and some rich nobles were not happy with him. This situation was good for Tariq ibn Ziyad. He was a governor in North Africa. In 711 AD, he led an army of about 7,000 soldiers across the water between Africa and Europe. He landed at a large rock. Later, people named it 'Jabal Tariq,' or the Mountain of Tariq. Today, we know it as Gibraltar. When his soldiers arrived, Tariq ordered them to burn their boats. He told his army: 'The sea is behind you, and the enemy is before you.' This brave speech helped his soldiers feel strong. Tariq’s army fought King Roderick at the Battle of Guadalete. Although the Visigoth army was much larger, Tariq used better plans. The unhappy Visigoth nobles also helped him win. King Roderick died in this fight. After this victory, Tariq took important cities like Cordoba and Toledo. His success began Muslim rule in Spain for nearly 800 years. Today, the name Gibraltar still remembers him.",

He wanted to control all the lands along the Silk Road. He fought and defeated many kings. His army was known for being very strong and very cruel. His most famous battle was against the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Sultan was named Yıldırım Bayezid. Bayezid was also a great conqueror and had a powerful army. The two armies met at the Battle of Ankara in 1402. The fighting was long and fierce in the very hot sun. Timur was a more clever military leader. He knew that some soldiers in Bayezid's army were unhappy. He convinced them to switch sides during the battle. This was the turning point. Timur won the battle. His army captured Sultan Bayezid. Bayezid became Timur's prisoner. The capture of the great Ottoman Sultan was a huge shock to the world. It stopped the growth of the Ottoman Empire for a time. After his victory, Timur continued traveling and conquering new lands. He took the captured Sultan Bayezid with him as he moved from place to place. Bayezid died while he was still Timur's prisoner. Timur died in 1405 while planning to invade China. His death saved China from his attack. Timur was one of history's greatest conquerors, also a brutal leader who showed no mercy to his enemies.",

She refused him, so Cyrus decided to attack. He crossed a river to fight her army, which was led by her son. The Persians used a clever plan. They left a camp full of wine and food. The Massagetae soldiers did not know wine well. They drank too much and fell asleep. The Persians attacked while they were sleeping and captured Tomyris's son. He felt great shame as a prisoner and killed himself. Tomyris was very angry and wanted revenge. She gathered all her soldiers for a second big battle later in 530 BC. The fight was very hard, but the Massagetae army won. King Cyrus died in the battle. After the fight, Tomyris found his body. She cut off his head and put it in a bag of blood.

However, while fighting near Corsica, he was captured by the Genoese and spent three years as a prisoner before Barbarossa rescued him. Upon regaining his freedom, Turgut built a new fleet and terrorized Spanish waters near Naples. He established a base on Djerba Island, where he famously escaped a Spanish siege by transporting his ships overland to the opposite coast. In 1551, Turgut was named Governor of Karli. Sultan Suleiman promised him rule over Tripoli if he helped capture it. Although the campaign succeeded, the position was initially given to another, leading a disappointed Turgut back to the sea. He finally received the Governorship of Tripoli in 1554 after bringing immense treasure to Istanbul. He continued to serve the Ottoman Empire, fighting at the Battle of Djerba in 1560. Turgut Reis ultimately fell in battle during the Siege of Malta in 1565; his tomb stands in Tripoli today.",

Later, Vlad became the ruler of Wallachia. He was a strict leader and became famous as 'Vlad the Impaler.' He fought against the Ottomans, even though he lived with them before. When Sultan Mehmed started a big war, Vlad fought back hard. He attacked at night to surprise them. He also burned villages and food so the Ottoman army had nothing to eat. But he lost the war.

One day, William Tell and his son walked through the square. They did not bow to the hat. Soldiers arrested Tell and brought him to Gessler. Gessler knew Tell was an excellent crossbow shooter. He created a cruel test. He ordered Tell's son to stand before a tree with an apple on his head. Tell had to shoot the apple. Success meant freedom. Failure meant death. Tell took two arrows. He used one arrow to shoot the apple perfectly. His son was safe. Gessler asked about the second arrow. Tell answered, 'If I had hurt my son, the second arrow was for you.' Gessler ordered Tell's arrest. Soldiers put Tell on a boat to a prison. A storm came on the lake. The frightened Austrians freed Tell to steer the boat. Tell guided the boat to shore and escaped. Later, Tell used his second arrow against Gessler. This action inspired the Swiss rebellion. The Swiss people fought and won their independence.",

This loud shot made the soldiers panic and run back toward their main camp in the dark. In the camp, soldiers woke up to the noise. They believed the enemy was attacking. Commanders shouted 'Halt!'—which means stop in German—to control their men. However, soldiers who spoke different languages heard 'Allah!' instead of 'Halt!' They were very afraid and fired guns and cannons at their own friends. Two days later, Yusuf Pasha arrived for a battle. Instead, he found dead and wounded Austrian soldiers everywhere.
