    <div id="story-text">Mezamorta Hüseyin Pasha was a famous Ottoman admiral born in the 17th century. Some people say he was originally from Spain and later became a Muslim. He started his career as a sailor and a pirate in the Mediterranean Sea. His interesting nickname, 'Mezamorta,' means 'half-dead' in Italian. In a big battle against the Venetians, he was hurt very badly. His enemies thought he was dead, but he survived. Because of this amazing event, he got his famous name. By 1674, he was a captain and attacked many enemy ships. In 1683, the French navy attacked Algiers. The leader of Algiers wanted to give up, but Mezamorta refused. He became the new ruler and defended the city. To show his strength, he put the French consul into a large cannon and fired him at the enemy ships. This stopped the French attack. Later, he attacked the French coast until they agreed to peace. Later, Mezamorta went to Istanbul to join the Ottoman navy. In 1695, he won back Chios Island from the Venetians. Because of this victory, the Sultan made him the Grand Admiral, or 'Kapudan Pasha.' He changed how the navy fought. He stopped using old rowing ships and started using big sailing ships called 'kalyons.' Mezamorta died from an illness in 1701 while getting ready for a new war.</div>
